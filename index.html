                <p>Through data-driven analysis, I develop interactivity, processes, or any training content to bridge the gap between the lowest and

                    Organizations who have used my services found actual solutions not ‘quick wins,’ improved efficiency in employees doing their job, 
                    mitigated risk, and lowered the cost of poor performers executing errors.

                    <br>
                    I'm just a 30 something, Latina who loves food and travel. I have 5+ years of instructional design experience building R.O.I., 
                    and I develop deep empathy with the people I'm designing for...keeping the learner in the center.

                        Your ability to pivot from one intense development task to another without missing a beat is impressive.  
                        Although it has only been a short while since we have been working together, 
                        I am blown away at the high quality work you have put into the study guide while at the same time helping me with 
                        training product research and keeping the team organized and on task. Your exceptional talents as an Instructional Designer 
                        are an asset to Flight Ops Training and to all the Pilots, Instructors, and Evaluators that our products will serve.
