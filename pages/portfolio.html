                    <p class = "work-words">Summary: This airline's onboarding training program consisted of on-the-job shadowing with anyone 'on shift'. Each new hire received four to six weeks of job shadowing before they could do the job on their own.  After a Needs Analysis it was discovered that every aircraft router had a different level of understanding of the software and its capabilities. For consistency and to train the company's software accurately to all aircraft routers, this program consisted of software simulations with Articulate Storyline, hands-on practice with the software, and learning the rules and regulations of aircraft routing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Measurable Objective:   At the end of one week of onboarding, the company will see a 43% increase in new hires utilizing the aircraft routing software and making effective decisions for the airline. We will meet this goal by using a building-block approach on learning the software, and creating a sandbox environment for new hires to practice making decisions to reroute aircraft based on various obstacles they would experience while on the job.

                    <p class = "work-words">Summary: A startup cybersecurity company obtained a new revenue stream. This revenue stream required entry-level IT personnel to analyze and investigate various artifacts and cases to support a senior team within the company. Due to IT personnel having less than one year experience in cybersecurity, and the company's current onboarding program taking five months for a new hire to confidently begin investigations, we needed to create an onboarding experience for all new hires to begin forensic investigation autonomously by the end of their first month with the company.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Measurable Objective: At the end of one-month of hiring, the company will see a 67% increase in new hires confidently accepting and investigating engagements autonomously. We will meet this goal by shortening current training from three to five months before a new hire can confidently take a case to one-month.

                    <p class = "work-words">Summary: This research institute's plan was to enroll 120,000 participants and retain them for ten years to track how their brain health changed over time. This research plan was free to participants and voluntary. Volunteers who met specific requirements  had to complete self-paced training and schedule coaching calls with the institute's experts. Because of this, we needed to build a momentum for ongoing support by creating an experience that kept participants engaged and motivated them into applying strategies from training and coaching sessions into their everyday lives. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Measurable Objective: At the end of the three modules, the institute will see a 12% increase in participants completing the training and making one incremental change in their routine. We will meet this goal by shortening the current training pieces, building empathy through a relatable story, and removing the ‘barrier of entry’ by making the course and journal entries text-based.
